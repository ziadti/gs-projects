# [Rubik's Cube Solver](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10OTPkxLJdIL_NgJDqd0XcLkZhfuBC6HyFQo6GIUBLqs/)

A Rubik's cube solver that uses the [Old Pochmann method](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/how-to-solve-the-rubiks-cube-blindfolded-tutorial/), a purely algorithmic intuitionless method that only solves one piece at a time designed for blindfolded solving. The lack of reliance on intuition makes this method easy to implement algorithmically with the drawback that the solutions result in a very long sequence of moves with an average that's over 300. (For reference, the [beginner's method](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/how-to-solve-the-rubiks-cube-beginners-method/) has an aaverage number of moves of ~110, [CFOP](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/advanced-cfop-fridrich/) has an average number of moves of ~55, [Roux](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/different-rubiks-cube-solving-methods/roux-method/) has an average number of moves of ~45.)
